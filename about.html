<p>Hi my name is Bram! I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia and moved to suburbs of Atlanta when he was 7 years old. I now lives in Decatur, GA with his wife, son, and cat name Hodor. I have passion for generating value using data, focusing on intuition and practical benefits. I enjoy story telling with data through data manipulation, machine learning, and visualizations.</p>
